# A4

This builds on A3, using synthetic GPS data in Salzburg. I created a `geo_utils.py` module with reusable geospatial functions and explored patterns using duration tags, activity filters, density maps, grids, and buffers.

I tried adding a map legend but ran into issues â€” so I just described it in markdown :)

This was a nice step up in organizing my code and making the analysis more visual and modular.
